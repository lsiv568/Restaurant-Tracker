#Restaurant-Tracker

This repository contains a restaurant tracking app I am in the process of creating to "scratch an itch".  

### Personal Itch
My wife and I enjoy going out to eat; often.  We love trying new restaurants and we tend forget what we ate, who we went with, when we went, if we liked it etc...  Also, when we drive by new restaurants we sometimes say "let's try this place".  Then a few weeks roll by and we want to head out to a new restaurant.  Neither one of us remembers that place we drove by.  So, this app will be used to track restaurants we have visited and restaurants we want to visit sometime in the future.

### Technical Itch
1. Play around with Kinvey BaaS
2. Play around with Handlebars.js


## To Do:
* Styling: need to create stylesheets and layout of app
	* ~~Two column layout - visited / desired~~
	* Overall LaF
* Separation: Create clean separation of JS code.  
	* ~~Integrate with Handlebars~~
	* ~~Define file/directory structure~~
* Add ability to create a desired restaurant
	* ~~Display desired restaurants~~
* Social Integration
	* Create login via Twitter/FB
	* Add ability to share restaurant visits 
* Validations
	* Client Side
	* Server Side
